Re-implementation of gstreamer tutorials in Python

# Motivation
[Gstreamer tutorials](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/) are awesome, but their complete implementation is only available in C. This repo provides alternative implementation in Python using [docs](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/main.html) for API reference
